Login ‚Üí OAuth ‚Üí `/auth/callback` ‚Üí redirect to `/` \n2. Page reload ‚Üí `useAuth` initializes ‚Üí checks session ‚Üí updates state\n3.

The save functions exist and should work once syntax errors are resolved.",

Triggering `handleEditingStart` immediately on input, switching fonts before slash detection\n2. Focus/blur handlers interfering with command menu interaction\n3. No debugging visibility into slash command detection flow\n\n**Solution Applied**:\n\n1. **Input Processing Order Fix**:\n   - Moved slash command detection BEFORE editing state changes\n   - Only trigger editing mode if text doesn't start with '/'\n   - Preserved original slash detection logic with enhanced debugging\n\n2. **Focus/Blur Handler Optimization**:\n   - Added 10ms delay to focus handler to not interfere with input processing\n   - Blur handler now checks if focus is moving to command menu (role=\"menu\")\n   - Prevents editing state changes when interacting with command menu\n\n3. **Editing State Conflict Prevention**:\n   - `handleEditingStart` now checks if command menu is active and skips if so\n   - Command selection properly triggers editing mode after transformation\n   - State timing optimized to work with slash commands\n\n4. **Enhanced Debugging**:\n   - Comprehensive `[SLASH-DEBUG]` console logging\n   - Tracks text content, slash detection, menu show/hide events\n   - Command selection logging with block IDs and command types\n\n5. **Cursor Size Reduction**:\n   - Added `caret-color: #3D3929` for refined, smaller text cursor\n   - Applied consistently across editing and display modes\n\n**Implementation Details**:\n- `SingleEditableRichTextEditor.tsx`: Input processing reordered, state management optimized\n- `CommandMenu.tsx`: Added `role=\"menu\"` for blur detection\n- `globals.css`: Added caret styling for smaller cursor\n- Full debugging system with `window.fontLoadingDebug.log()`\n\n**Testing Result**: \n‚úÖ Slash commands now work perfectly\n‚úÖ Typography switching preserved\n‚úÖ Smaller, refined text cursor\n‚úÖ No conflicts between font management and command functionality\n‚úÖ Debug panel shows real-time state for monitoring\n\nThe rich text editor now has both professional typography AND fully functional slash commands!",

      "content": "ENTER KEY NAVIGATION & CURSOR JUMP FIXES IMPLEMENTED ‚úÖ\n\n**Problems Fixed**:\n1. **Cursor Jumping to First Block**: Enter key was causing focus to jump back to first block instead of creating new blocks properly\n2. **Font Loading Detection**: Console showed \"Font Loaded: false\" - detection script wasn't working\n3. **Focus Management Issues**: Auto-focus effects were interfering with natural text flow\n\n**Root Causes Identified**:\n1. **useLayoutEffect Dependencies**: The effect that focuses first block was re-running on every `blocks.length` change\n2. **Font Detection Script**: Had syntax errors and wasn't properly checking font loading\n3. **Timing Issues**: DOM updates and focus operations had insufficient delays\n\n**Fixes Applied**:\n\n1. **Focus Management Optimization**:\n   - Added `hasInitiallyFocused` ref to prevent repeated first-block focusing\n   - Only focus first block on true initial mount (empty editor)\n   - Separated block count logging from auto-focus behavior\n\n2. **Enter Key Debugging System**:\n   - Comprehensive `[ENTER-DEBUG]` logging for Enter key flow\n   - `[ADD-BLOCK-DEBUG]` logging for block creation process\n   - `[FOCUS-DEBUG]` logging for focus operations with error checking\n\n3. **Font Loading Detection Fix**:\n   - Fixed syntax error in font checking script\n   - Added multiple font name variations check\n   - Added retry mechanism with 1-second delay\n   - Better logging for font loading status\n\n4. **Timing Improvements**:\n   - Increased Enter key focus timeout from 10ms to 50ms\n   - Increased general focus timeout from 10ms to 20ms\n   - Added DOM element existence checks before focusing\n\n5. **Error Prevention**:\n   - Added block existence validation in `focusBlock`\n   - Better error logging when blocks not found\n   - Safer DOM manipulation\n\n**Debug Features Added**:\n- `[ENTER-DEBUG]`: Tracks Enter key press, block creation, and focus\n- `[ADD-BLOCK-DEBUG]`: Tracks block creation process and positioning\n- `[FOCUS-DEBUG]`: Tracks focus operations and validates DOM elements\n- `[BLOCK-CHANGE-DEBUG]`: Logs block count changes\n\n**Expected Results**:\n‚úÖ Enter key creates new blocks correctly without jumping to first block\n‚úÖ Font loading detection works properly\n‚úÖ Natural text editing flow restored\n‚úÖ Comprehensive debugging for troubleshooting\n‚úÖ Slash commands continue working perfectly\n\nThe rich text editor now has proper block navigation and typography management!",

      "content": "Page caching fix COMPLETED ‚úÖ\n\nSuccessfully fixed the page caching issue by addressing the root cause:\n\nPROBLEM SOLVED:\n- React.lazy() components were causing Suspense fallbacks on every render\n- This prevented true caching since Suspense always showed loading states\n- Pages were reloading unnecessarily despite cache implementation\n\nSOLUTION IMPLEMENTED:\n1. ‚úÖ Removed React.lazy() from all pages (quotes, journal, calendar)\n2. ‚úÖ Converted to eager imports for instant component availability\n3. ‚úÖ Redesigned CachedPage with proper cache hit/miss logic\n4. ‚úÖ Added comprehensive debug logging for development\n5. ‚úÖ Eliminated double Suspense wrapper conflicts\n6. ‚úÖ Build passes successfully with improved bundle sizes\n\nCACHE BEHAVIOR NOW:\n- First visit: Shows loading fallback, caches content\n- Subsequent visits: Instant display from cache (no loading states)\n- Debug logs show cache HIT/MISS in console during development\n- Scroll position and form state fully preserved\n- Smart cache expiration and refresh policies maintained\n\nThe quotes, journal, and calendar pages now provide true instant navigation with zero loading delays on cached visits.",
