Login ‚Üí OAuth ‚Üí `/auth/callback` ‚Üí redirect to `/` \n2. Page reload ‚Üí `useAuth` initializes ‚Üí checks session ‚Üí updates state\n3.

Triggering `handleEditingStart` immediately on input, switching fonts before slash detection\n2. Focus/blur handlers interfering with command menu interaction\n3. No debugging visibility into slash command detection flow\n\n**Solution Applied**:\n\n1. **Input Processing Order Fix**:\n   - Moved slash command detection BEFORE editing state changes\n   - Only trigger editing mode if text doesn't start with '/'\n   - Preserved original slash detection logic with enhanced debugging\n\n2. **Focus/Blur Handler Optimization**:\n   - Added 10ms delay to focus handler to not interfere with input processing\n   - Blur handler now checks if focus is moving to command menu (role=\"menu\")\n   - Prevents editing state changes when interacting with command menu\n\n3. **Editing State Conflict Prevention**:\n   - `handleEditingStart` now checks if command menu is active and skips if so\n   - Command selection properly triggers editing mode after transformation\n   - State timing optimized to work with slash commands\n\n4. **Enhanced Debugging**:\n   - Comprehensive `[SLASH-DEBUG]` console logging\n   - Tracks text content, slash detection, menu show/hide events\n   - Command selection logging with block IDs and command types\n\n5. **Cursor Size Reduction**:\n   - Added `caret-color: #3D3929` for refined, smaller text cursor\n   - Applied consistently across editing and display modes\n\n**Implementation Details**:\n- `SingleEditableRichTextEditor.tsx`: Input processing reordered, state management optimized\n- `CommandMenu.tsx`: Added `role=\"menu\"` for blur detection\n- `globals.css`: Added caret styling for smaller cursor\n- Full debugging system with `window.fontLoadingDebug.log()`\n\n**Testing Result**: \n‚úÖ Slash commands now work perfectly\n‚úÖ Typography switching preserved\n‚úÖ Smaller, refined text cursor\n‚úÖ No conflicts between font management and command functionality\n‚úÖ Debug panel shows real-time state for monitoring\n\nThe rich text editor now has both professional typography AND fully functional slash commands!",

      "content": "ENTER KEY NAVIGATION & CURSOR JUMP FIXES IMPLEMENTED ‚úÖ\n\n**Problems Fixed**:\n1. **Cursor Jumping to First Block**: Enter key was causing focus to jump back to first block instead of creating new blocks properly\n2. **Font Loading Detection**: Console showed \"Font Loaded: false\" - detection script wasn't working\n3. **Focus Management Issues**: Auto-focus effects were interfering with natural text flow\n\n**Root Causes Identified**:\n1. **useLayoutEffect Dependencies**: The effect that focuses first block was re-running on every `blocks.length` change\n2. **Font Detection Script**: Had syntax errors and wasn't properly checking font loading\n3. **Timing Issues**: DOM updates and focus operations had insufficient delays\n\n**Fixes Applied**:\n\n1. **Focus Management Optimization**:\n   - Added `hasInitiallyFocused` ref to prevent repeated first-block focusing\n   - Only focus first block on true initial mount (empty editor)\n   - Separated block count logging from auto-focus behavior\n\n2. **Enter Key Debugging System**:\n   - Comprehensive `[ENTER-DEBUG]` logging for Enter key flow\n   - `[ADD-BLOCK-DEBUG]` logging for block creation process\n   - `[FOCUS-DEBUG]` logging for focus operations with error checking\n\n3. **Font Loading Detection Fix**:\n   - Fixed syntax error in font checking script\n   - Added multiple font name variations check\n   - Added retry mechanism with 1-second delay\n   - Better logging for font loading status\n\n4. **Timing Improvements**:\n   - Increased Enter key focus timeout from 10ms to 50ms\n   - Increased general focus timeout from 10ms to 20ms\n   - Added DOM element existence checks before focusing\n\n5. **Error Prevention**:\n   - Added block existence validation in `focusBlock`\n   - Better error logging when blocks not found\n   - Safer DOM manipulation\n\n**Debug Features Added**:\n- `[ENTER-DEBUG]`: Tracks Enter key press, block creation, and focus\n- `[ADD-BLOCK-DEBUG]`: Tracks block creation process and positioning\n- `[FOCUS-DEBUG]`: Tracks focus operations and validates DOM elements\n- `[BLOCK-CHANGE-DEBUG]`: Logs block count changes\n\n**Expected Results**:\n‚úÖ Enter key creates new blocks correctly without jumping to first block\n‚úÖ Font loading detection works properly\n‚úÖ Natural text editing flow restored\n‚úÖ Comprehensive debugging for troubleshooting\n‚úÖ Slash commands continue working perfectly\n\nThe rich text editor now has proper block navigation and typography management!",

Root Cause Analysis:\n   - The save logic appears comprehensive and should work\n   - Bug likely occurs due to timing issues or async operation failures\n   - Possible issue: If Supabase save fails silently, user might lose changes when reloading\n   - Another issue: localStorage save might not be properly scoped to entry IDs",

Added isInitialized state to track when user context is ready\n2. Delayed loadEntries() until after initialization is complete\n3. Enhanced auth state change handler to:\n   - Clear old data immediately\n   - Update userId \n   - Reload entries with correct user-specific manager\n4. Updated loading state to show \"Initializing journal...\" vs \"Loading your journal...\"\n\nResult:\n- No more glitchy display of wrong entries\n- Smooth user switching without data leakage\n- Proper loading states during initialization\n- Each user sees only their own entries from the start\n- Clean, secure user isolation maintained",

Updated HomePage.tsx:\n   - Replaced static \"7\" with dynamic journalStats.currentStreak\n   - Shows loading animation while fetching\n   - Displays \"0\" if no streak or no user\n\n3. Streak calculation logic:\n   - Counts consecutive days from most recent entry\n   - Streak breaks if most recent entry is older than yesterday\n   - One entry per day counts (multiple entries same day = 1 day)\n   - Handles timezone correctly by setting hours to midnight\n\nThe Journal card now dynamically shows the user's daily journaling streak!\n\nYes Daddy ü•∞",

This triggers another onChange to JournalNavigation's handleBlocksChange\n6. handleBlocksChange calls journalManager.updateEntryImmediately\n7. Due to React's batching and async nature, multiple onChange events fire in rapid succession\n8. Each onChange triggers a separate updateEntryImmediately call\n9. The journal.ts code has race condition checks but they're not sufficient\n\nThe problem is compounded by:\n- No debouncing on the onChange propagation chain\n- React's synthetic event batching causing multiple updates\n- The updateEntryImmediately function throwing errors when entry doesn't exist (lines 368-376 in journal.ts)\n\nSolution needed:\n1. Add debouncing to the onChange handler chain\n2. Ensure only one update operation happens per keystroke\n3. Add better race condition prevention\n4.

The system is working as designed with the following flow:\n\n1. **LOCAL FIRST ARCHITECTURE**: Changes are immediately saved to localStorage via `updateEntryImmediately()` \n2. **ASYNC DATABASE SYNC**: Database sync happens in background via `syncPendingChanges()` every 5 seconds\n3. **DEBOUNCED SAVES**: The editor uses debouncing (50-200ms) to batch rapid changes before triggering saves\n\nThe perceived issue is that:\n- User expects instant database persistence (like Google Docs)\n- But the system uses eventual consistency with localStorage as primary storage\n- Database sync happens asynchronously in background\n- On page reload, data is first loaded from localStorage, then synced from database\n\nThe subscription changes did NOT break the sync. The system has always worked this way.\n\nKey files:\n- `/src/lib/journal.ts`: RealTimeJournalManager handles localStorage + async DB sync\n- `/src/components/journal/JournalNavigation.tsx`: Debounced save calls (line 240-268)\n- `/src/hooks/useCachedJournal.ts`: handleUpdateEntry saves to localStorage first (line 227-276)\n\nThe sync is working but appears broken because:\n1. User sees \"syncing\" status but expects immediate DB save\n2. localStorage saves work instantly but DB sync is delayed\n3. No visual feedback that localStorage save succeeded",

EnhancedRichTextEditor calls onChange IMMEDIATELY (no debouncing) on every keystroke\n2. JournalNavigation has a 300ms debounce for parent updates but saves immediately to localStorage\n3. FastSync has aggressive timings: 50ms change buffer, 100ms save debouncer\n4. Multiple nested saves happen: localStorage ‚Üí FastSync ‚Üí database sync\n5. Excessive console logging happens on every keystroke\n6. Mutex blocking may cause queuing of updates\n\nThe freezing is likely caused by:\n- Too many immediate localStorage writes per keystroke\n- Excessive console.log statements (10+ per keystroke)\n- Multiple verification checks and retries on each save\n- Memory leaks from uncleaned timeouts and intervals\n- React re-renders triggered by immediate state updates",
