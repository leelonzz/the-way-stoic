# Journal Loading Implementation Test

## Implementation Summary

✅ **Completed**: Implemented proper loading state for journal page to prevent blank/flash behavior

### Changes Made:

1. **Created JournalSkeleton Component** (`src/components/journal/JournalSkeleton.tsx`)
   - Replicates the journal layout with gray loading placeholders
   - Left sidebar with search bar, create button, and entry list skeletons
   - Right main area with header and editor content skeletons
   - Uses the same `Skeleton` component as the calendar page

2. **Modified Journal Page** (`app/journal/page.tsx`)
   - Wrapped Journal component with `CachedPage`
   - Added `JournalSkeleton` as fallback
   - Configured cache settings: 5-minute maxAge, refreshOnFocus enabled
   - Maintains existing ErrorBoundary for error handling

### Expected Behavior:

1. **First Visit**: Shows JournalSkeleton immediately, then transitions to actual content
2. **Subsequent Visits**: Shows cached content immediately (no loading state)
3. **Cache Expiry**: After 5 minutes, shows skeleton again on next visit
4. **Focus Refresh**: Refreshes cache when returning to tab (if expired)

### Testing Steps:

1. ✅ Navigate to `/journal` - should show skeleton loading state
2. ✅ Wait for content to load - should transition smoothly to actual journal
3. ✅ Navigate away and back - should show cached content immediately
4. ✅ No compilation errors or runtime errors
5. ✅ Maintains all existing journal functionality

### Technical Details:

- **Cache Key**: `"journal"`
- **Cache Duration**: 5 minutes (shorter than calendar due to frequent updates)
- **Fallback**: `<JournalSkeleton />`
- **Refresh Strategy**: On focus if cache expired

## Result: ✅ SUCCESS

The journal page now has the same smooth loading experience as the calendar page, eliminating the blank/flash behavior that was previously occurring during navigation.
