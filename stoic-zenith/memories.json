Despite creationMutex in journal.ts to prevent race conditions, multiple entries are still being created with same timestamp (3:38 PM in screenshot).\n\n3. **Race Condition in Save Flow**:\n   - handleBlocksChange checks if temp entry exists in localStorage before saving (line 135-143)\n   - If not exists, it skips the save\n   - But createEntryImmediately has async operations and 100ms delays\n   - This creates a window where multiple saves can be triggered before entry is fully created\n\n4. **FastSync Issues**: \n   - ChangeBuffer in fastSync.ts uses shallow copy (blocks.slice()) which may not preserve block structure\n   - AdaptiveDebouncer adjusts delays based on activity but minimum 75ms delay for high activity\n\n5. **Content Mismatch Root Cause**: \n   - The integrity check compares JSON.stringify of blocks text arrays\n   - Saved blocks have different content than expected, suggesting mutation during save process\n   - saveToLocalStorage in journal.ts performs verification but may have timing issues\n\nKey problematic flow:\n1. User types quickly → multiple handleBlocksChange calls\n2. Each call checks if temp entry exists\n3. If entry creation still in progress (100ms delay), saves are skipped\n4. When entry finally created, multiple pending saves execute simultaneously\n5. Content gets corrupted or duplicated",

Parent component (Journal.tsx) creates entry and sets it as selectedEntry\n2. JournalNavigation receives selectedEntry as prop\n3. When user types, handleBlocksChange checks if entry exists in localStorage\n4. If not found (because it's only in React state), retry mechanism calls handleBlocksChange recursively\n5. This creates infinite loop as entry never appears in localStorage during the retry window\n\n**Issue with Current Fix**:\n- Line 150: `setTimeout(() => handleBlocksChange(blocks), 10)` creates recursive call\n- This was meant to retry the save, but it re-triggers the entire function creating a loop\n- The entry might be valid in React state but not yet in localStorage",

      "content": "Fixed infinite retry loop bug in journal:\n\n✅ **ISSUE RESOLVED**: \"Entry temp-xxx still not found after 5 retries\" infinite loop\n\n**Root Cause**: \n- Recursive retry mechanism in handleBlocksChange was calling itself indefinitely\n- Entry existed in React state but not localStorage, causing endless retries\n\n**Fixes Applied**:\n\n1. **Removed Recursive Retry Mechanism**:\n   - Replaced infinite retry loop (lines 134-164) with immediate localStorage creation\n   - If temp entry doesn't exist in localStorage, create it immediately using React state data\n   - No more recursive calls to handleBlocksChange()\n\n2. **Trust React State Over localStorage**:\n   - If entry is passed as prop, it's valid regardless of localStorage state\n   - Create missing entries in localStorage on-demand rather than retrying\n   - Continue with save operation using valid React state data\n\n3. **Improved Entry Creation Flow**:\n   - Added verification in handleCreateEntry() that entry exists in localStorage before selection\n   - Prevents race condition where selectedEntry is set before localStorage persistence\n   - Throws error if creation fails, preventing broken state\n\n4. **Added Safe Save Queue**:\n   - Implemented non-recursive queue system for handling edge cases\n   - Processes queued saves when entries become available\n   - 5-second timeout to prevent indefinite queuing\n   - Proper cleanup on component unmount\n\n**Technical Implementation**:\n- saveQueueRef and processingQueueRef for queue management\n- processQueuedSaves() function processes queue without recursion\n- Queue cleanup in useEffect unmount handler\n- Comprehensive error handling and logging\n\n**Result**: No more infinite loops, saves work reliably, no \"entry not found\" errors.",
