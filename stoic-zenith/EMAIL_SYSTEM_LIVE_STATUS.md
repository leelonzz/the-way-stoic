## 🚀 Production Flow

### When a Real User Subscribes:

1. **User completes payment** on DodoPayments checkout page
2. **DodoPayments sends webhook** to `https://thewaystoic.site/api/dodo/webhook`
3. **Your webhook handler**:
   - ✅ Validates webhook signature
   - ✅ Extracts user ID from subscription metadata
   - ✅ Updates user profile to "philosopher" plan in Supabase
   - ✅ Sends subscription confirmation email via Resend
   - ✅ Logs success/failure for monitoring
4. **User receives email** within seconds of payment completion

## 🔧 Monitoring & Debugging

### Check Email Delivery
1. **Resend Dashboard**: https://resend.com/emails
   - View all sent emails
   - Check delivery status
   - Monitor bounce/spam rates

2. **Server Logs**: Check your application logs for:
   ```
   ✅ Subscription confirmation email sent: [email-id]
   📧 Subscription confirmation email sent to [email]
   ```

3. **Error Handling**: If emails fail:
   - Check Resend API key is correct
   - Verify domain DNS settings
   - Monitor rate limits
   - Check recipient email validity

### Webhook Monitoring
- **DodoPayments Dashboard**: Monitor webhook delivery
- **Your logs**: Check `/api/dodo/webhook` endpoint logs
- **Test endpoint**: Use `/api/test-webhook` for debugging

## 🎯 Next Steps

### For Production Deployment:
1. **Deploy to production** with the same environment variables
2. **Update DodoPayments webhook URL** to your production domain
3. **Test with real payments** in DodoPayments test mode first
4. **Monitor email delivery** for the first few transactions

### Optional Enhancements:
1. **Email preferences** in user settings
2. **Email analytics** tracking
3. **A/B testing** different email templates
4. **Automated follow-up** emails for engagement

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Email Not Received?
1. **Check spam folder** (common for new domains)
2. **Verify email address** is correct
3. **Check Resend dashboard** for delivery status
4. **Test with different email providers** (Gmail, Outlook, etc.)

### Webhook Issues?
1. **Check DodoPayments webhook logs**
2. **Verify webhook secret** matches your environment
3. **Test with `/api/test-webhook`** endpoint
4. **Monitor server logs** for errors
