# Quote Loading Fixes

## Problem
When navigating to another page and then coming back to the home page or quotes page, the quotes would not load properly and required a page reload to function.

## Root Causes Identified

### 1. Complex Tab Visibility Logic
- The `useTabVisibility` hook had overly complex logic that wasn't triggering properly on navigation
- Multiple conditions and thresholds made it unreliable for SPA navigation

### 2. Caching Interference
- The `CachedPage` component was caching stale quote data
- Page cache wasn't being invalidated properly for dynamic content

### 3. React Query Configuration
- `refetchOnWindowFocus: false` prevented automatic refetching
- No `refetchOnMount` setting meant components didn't refresh on mount

### 4. Navigation-Aware Loading
- No mechanism to detect navigation to quote pages
- No automatic refetch when returning to quote pages

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Simplified Tab Visibility Logic
- Reduced complexity in `useTabVisibility.ts`
- Simplified refresh conditions to be more reliable
- Better logging for debugging

### 2. Navigation-Aware Quote Loading
- Added `usePathname` tracking in `useQuotes.ts`
- Automatic refetch when navigating to quote pages (`/` or `/quotes`)
- Time-based refresh logic (30 seconds threshold)

### 3. Improved React Query Configuration
- Enabled `refetchOnWindowFocus: true`
- Added `refetchOnMount: 'always'`
- Better retry and cache settings

### 4. Removed Caching for Quotes
- Disabled `CachedPage` wrapper for quotes page
- Prevents stale cache issues

### 5. Added Error Recovery
- Added `forceRefresh` function to `useQuotes`
- Error state handling in `HomePage` with retry button
- Better error logging and debugging

### 6. Enhanced Debugging
- Added comprehensive logging throughout the quote loading process
- Debug information in `HomePage` component
- Test script for verification

## Key Changes Made

### Files Modified:
1. `src/hooks/useTabVisibility.ts` - Simplified logic
2. `src/hooks/useQuotes.ts` - Added navigation tracking and force refresh
3. `src/components/providers/ClientProviders.tsx` - Updated React Query config
4. `app/quotes/page.tsx` - Removed CachedPage wrapper
5. `src/components/HomePage.tsx` - Added error handling and debugging

### New Features:
- Navigation-aware quote loading
- Force refresh capability
- Better error recovery
- Comprehensive debugging
- Test script for verification

## Testing

### Manual Testing:
1. Navigate to home page - quotes should load
2. Navigate to another page (e.g., journal)
3. Navigate back to home page - quotes should load without reload
4. Navigate to quotes page - quotes should load
5. Navigate away and back - quotes should load

### Automated Testing:
Run the test script in browser console:
```javascript
// Copy and paste the contents of test-quote-navigation.js
```

## Expected Behavior

### Before Fix:
- Quotes would not load when navigating back to home/quotes pages
- Required manual page reload to see quotes
- No error handling or recovery options

### After Fix:
- Quotes load automatically when navigating to quote pages
- Automatic refresh when returning after 30+ seconds
- Error handling with retry button
- Better debugging and logging
- More reliable tab visibility handling

## Monitoring

Check browser console for debug logs:
- `üîç [useQuotes]` - Quote loading events
- `üîç [TabVisibility]` - Tab visibility events
- `üîç [HomePage]` - Home page quote state

## Future Improvements

1. **Performance Optimization**: Consider implementing quote preloading
2. **Offline Support**: Add offline quote caching
3. **User Preferences**: Allow users to configure refresh behavior
4. **Analytics**: Track quote loading success rates
5. **Progressive Enhancement**: Add loading skeletons and better UX
